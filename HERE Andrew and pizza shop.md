As with the previous table, the suggestions here are representative and may not apply to all situations or all pizza stores. Each business would need to evaluate the potential benefits and costs of these technologies based on their specific circumstances.

But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies? (01:08) Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build. They may require dozens of highly skilled engineers, (01:14) and they may cost millions or tens of millions of dollars to build an AI system. (01:19) And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions (01:22) or even billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off (01:28) because, for them, a one-size-fits-all AI system, such as one that improves web search (01:35) or that recommends better products for online shopping, can be applied to [these] very large numbers of users (01:41) to generate a massive amount of revenue. But this recipe for AI does not work (01:47) once you go outside the tech and internet sectors to other places where, for the most part, (01:53) there are hardly any projects that apply to 100 million people or that generate comparable economics. 

(02:00) Let me illustrate an example. Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store (02:09) to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. (02:14) And his pizza is great, but he always has a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, (02:19) and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. But when I watch him operate his store, (02:25) I get excited, because by selling pizza, (02:29) he is generating data. And this is data that he can take advantage of (02:34) if he had access to AI. AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, (02:43) and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, (02:48) maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon. Now you might say to me, "Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. (02:56) What's the big deal?" And I say, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, (03:01) something that could help him improve his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him.

Andrew Ng's story about the local pizza store owner highlights the application of AI in predicting customer behavior and optimizing inventory. In the table we've created, this specific scenario can be attributed to a few lines:

1. Under **Operations** in the New Top-line Revenue section: "AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon." This relates to the use of AI in optimizing inventory and food preparation, leading to more efficient operations and potential increase in sales.

2. Under **Marketing** in the Cost Efficiency section: The pizza owner could analyze customer data to identify patterns in pizza flavor popularity. This could allow him to invest more in promoting popular flavors, leading to more efficient use of marketing resources.

3. Under **Sales** in the New Top-line Revenue section: The pizza owner could utilize AI to suggest more popular pizza flavors to customers, encouraging them to try different flavors and potentially increasing sales.

4. Under **R&D** in the New Top-line Revenue section: The data-driven approach to understanding what types of pizzas sell best on certain days can be seen as a form of low-cost product innovation. The pizza owner is effectively using AI to conduct ongoing market research and improve his product offerings based on customer preferences. 

In summary, Andrew Ng's story shows that even a small business like a pizza store can leverage AI to improve operations, marketing, sales, and R&D, ultimately leading to cost savings and increased revenues.

Absolutely. Here's a simplified version of the previous table that pinpoints examples with minimal effort required from the pizza store owner:

| Internal Functions   | Cost Efficiency (Technology Utilized)                        | New Top-line Revenue (Technology Utilized)                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Operations           | Digital inventory management (Cloud Computing) can minimize waste and improve efficiency. | Mobile order and delivery (Mobile Tech & AI) can extend service hours and reach. |
| Marketing            | Local digital marketing (Social Media & SEO) can target resources effectively. | Social media marketing (Digital Marketing Tools) can expand local visibility. |
| Sales                | Digital payment systems (Mobile Tech & AI) can improve sales efficiency and reduce errors. | Online ordering (Website & Mobile App) can expand market reach and improve sales speed. |
| Human Resources      | Digital shift scheduling (Cloud Computing) can save time and optimize labor. | Efficient hiring platforms (AI & Cloud Computing) can speed up the hiring process and bring in high-quality employees. |
| Finance & Accounting | Digital bookkeeping (Cloud Computing) can reduce costs of financial reporting. | Real-time sales analytics (Big Data & AI) can enable dynamic pricing strategies. |
| R&D                  | Online customer feedback (Social Media & AI) can drive low-cost product innovation. | Data-driven menu development (AI & Big Data) can lead to popular new offerings. |
| IT                   | Cloud-based solutions (Cloud Computing) can reduce hardware costs. | High-speed Wi-Fi for customers (Internet Technology) can attract more customers. |
| Physical Security    | Digital surveillance systems (AI & IoT) can reduce security personnel costs. | A secure store environment (AI & IoT) can increase customer trust and loyalty. |

All these methods require minimal effort and can be implemented using available digital platforms and services. They are designed for users without advanced technical knowledge, so even a small pizza store owner can start leveraging these technologies.



Several of the examples provided can be viewed as marketing tactics, even though they might not fall strictly under the "Marketing" category. Here they are:

1. **Marketing** - Cost Efficiency: "Local digital marketing (Social Media & SEO) can target resources effectively."

2. **Marketing** - New Top-line Revenue: "Social media marketing (Digital Marketing Tools) can expand local visibility."

3. **Sales** - New Top-line Revenue: "Online ordering (Website & Mobile App) can expand market reach and improve sales speed." While this is primarily a sales tactic, it also functions as a marketing tool by broadening the visibility of the store and making it easier for customers to place orders.

4. **R&D** - New Top-line Revenue: "Data-driven menu development (AI & Big Data) can lead to popular new offerings." The new offerings can then be promoted to drive customer interest and increase sales.

5. **IT** - New Top-line Revenue: "High-speed Wi-Fi for customers (Internet Technology) can attract more customers." This can be promoted as a value-added service for customers, effectively serving as a marketing tool. 

Each of these strategies involves some form of communication with customers or potential customers, making them relevant to the field of marketing.

Sure, let's adjust the table to present this information more understandably for a pizza shop owner:

Please note that the impact can vary based on the specific circumstances of the business. Also, this table considers each function independently, but in reality, there can be synergies between different functions. For instance, advertising effectively can lead to more sales, which would influence the "Making and Selling Pizzas" function.

Sure, I can map the HERE framework to the local pizza shop owner's world:

1. **Hungry**
   - **Customer-centricity**: The owner can focus on making the best pizzas according to customers' tastes and preferences. For instance, if customers love a particular pizza type, ensure it's always available.
   - **Innovation**: The owner could experiment with different pizza toppings or introduce unique pizza styles to attract more customers.
   - **Market Expansion**: The owner can enter into online sales or catering services to reach a larger customer base.

2. **Efficient**
   - **Process optimization**: Implementing a digital system for inventory and orders to reduce waste and ensure efficient operations.
   - **Technological innovation**: Using digital payment systems and online ordering can speed up service and increase the capacity for orders.
   - **Organizational structure**: The owner can foster a cooperative environment among the staff to ensure smooth operations. 

3. **Resilient**
   - **Diversification**: The owner could offer a wide range of products besides pizzas (like salads, sandwiches, or desserts) to attract a broader customer base.
   - **Innovation culture**: Regularly try out new pizza recipes or services based on customers' feedback and current food trends.
   - **Financial health**: The owner should regularly track revenues and costs, ensuring that the business remains profitable.

4. **Enlightened**
   - **Sustainable practices**: Use locally-sourced ingredients to support local farmers and reduce carbon footprint.
   - **Social responsibility**: Engage with the local community by sponsoring local events or donating leftovers to food banks.
   - **Innovative solutions**: Maybe introduce plant-based or low-carb options for customers with dietary restrictions, addressing a social need and expanding the customer base.
   

The pizza shop owner can incorporate these strategies into his business model to achieve success in each of these four dimensions of the HERE framework.

The responses to these questions are as follows; 1/ Strengths: one unique recipe for garlic pizza, the main owner is trained in Sicily but the rest of the workers are local, reputation is strong in the neighborhood, and the location of the shop is on the busiest street of a university campus, 2/ Weaknesses: high staff turnover, the business is carrying debt due to a spate of floods that caused damages in prior years, calzones are popular and they haven't gotten around to making them, customer reviews are negative from younger college students expecting more hip ingredients, 3/ Opportunities: catering is an option that has never taken off, there's a new tech startup community forming nearby, we've been wanting to get on the web and capable of taking orders online, and there's an annual food fair that is coming up soon, 4/ Threats: the competition is younger and is offering pizzas at lowe rprices, we see a lot of older businesses unable to compete, we're worried that the cost of cheese is rising, and there's luckily no regulatory changes locally.

____

Based on this information, we can provide a SWOT analysis tailored to the specific circumstances of this pizza shop owner:

|                              | Strengths                                                    | Weaknesses                                                   | Opportunities                                                | Threats                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Save Money**               | Being on a busy university street means high visibility and foot traffic, so less need to spend on marketing. | High staff turnover can be a significant cost. Consider introducing staff retention strategies like competitive wages or perks. | Utilizing technology to take online orders can streamline operations, reducing manpower costs. | The competition offering cheaper pizzas could force you into a price war, negatively affecting profit margins. |
| **Enhance Existing Revenue** | Your strong reputation in the neighborhood and unique Sicilian training could enable price premium for quality. | Negative reviews from younger customers could be affecting your sales. Consider updating your menu with more "hip" ingredients. | Catering and participating in the annual food fair could boost sales significantly. | Rising cheese prices could increase your cost of goods sold, which may require a price adjustment that could affect sales. |
| **New Revenue**              | Your unique garlic pizza recipe could be a signature dish that differentiates you from competitors. | Lack of popular items like calzones is a missed sales opportunity. | The new tech startup community nearby is a potential new market for your pizzas. Start a delivery service or provide special offers to attract them. | Older businesses being unable to compete could foreshadow challenges for your own business if not kept up-to-date with customer trends and competition. |

It's important to consider that while SWOT analysis provides a snapshot of the current situation, ongoing analysis and adjustment are needed as conditions change. For example, if the tech startup community grows significantly, they could become a major customer segment for your pizzas, impacting both your strengths and opportunities.

Here's how AI technologies could be leveraged in each scenario:

|                              | Strengths                                                    | Weaknesses                                                   | Opportunities                                                | Threats                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Save Money**               | AI could analyze foot traffic patterns to optimize opening hours, reducing costs during low demand periods. | AI-powered HR platforms could help to identify patterns in staff turnover and recommend ways to improve retention. | AI could automate the process of taking orders online, reducing labor costs. | AI could be used to track and analyze competitor pricing, enabling more strategic pricing decisions. |
| **Enhance Existing Revenue** | AI could help identify patterns in sales data to better understand what influences pricing tolerance among customers. | AI sentiment analysis could help understand specific customer complaints, enabling targeted improvements. | AI could optimize catering menus based on event type/size and current ingredient inventory. | AI could predict cheese price trends based on market data, helping to manage inventory and pricing strategies. |
| **New Revenue**              | AI could identify popular add-ons or pairings with your garlic pizza, suggesting new menu items. | AI could provide recipes or methods for making cost-effective, popular items like calzones. | AI could analyze the preferences of the tech community, suggesting targeted marketing strategies or new offerings. | AI could help to monitor business trends, alerting you to potential threats like increased competition or changing customer preferences. |

Remember, while AI can provide many benefits, it also requires investment and may come with its own challenges, such as data privacy concerns or implementation difficulties. Therefore, it's important to consider the cost-benefit ratio of each AI application for your specific situation.



While AI systems like large language models typically require digital inputs and cannot directly analyze handwritten data, the shop owner can manually collect and input data into an AI system. Here's how he could use AI with manual data collection:

|                              | Strengths                                                    | Weaknesses                                                   | Opportunities                                                | Threats                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Save Money**               | Note down foot traffic patterns and sales. Feed data to AI to optimize opening hours. | Keep track of why staff leave (exit interviews) and feed this data into an AI HR system to receive suggestions on improving retention. | Record all orders, customer interactions, and response times. Use an AI system to understand how online ordering can optimize this process. | Regularly jot down competitor pricing and use AI to analyze the data, allowing more strategic pricing. |
| **Enhance Existing Revenue** | Keep a log of daily sales and any influencing factors (e.g., weather, events). Use AI to analyze patterns and inform pricing. | Track customer complaints and reviews manually. Use AI for sentiment analysis to understand and address issues. | Record data from small catering gigs. AI can help optimize catering menus and operations based on this data. | Manually track cheese prices and input data into an AI system to predict future trends. |
| **New Revenue**              | Note down what additional items customers order with the garlic pizza. Use AI to suggest potential new menu items. | Experiment with different calzone recipes and keep track of customer feedback. Use AI to analyze feedback and improve the recipe. | Collect information about local tech community (like popular orders, peak times). AI could analyze this data to inform marketing or new offerings. | Manually monitor business trends, competition, and customer preferences. Feed this data to an AI for insights and alerts. |

The shop owner can start with a simple spreadsheet to collect and analyze this data, then gradually adopt more sophisticated AI tools as he becomes more comfortable with the process.

In general experts tell you to focus on your strengths when faced with a SWOT. How do you approach the other three dimensions?

---

While focusing on your strengths is indeed a commonly suggested approach, the other three dimensions in the SWOT analysis—weaknesses, opportunities, and threats—are equally important to consider. Here's how you might approach each:

1. **Weaknesses**: These are internal factors that might be hindering your performance. The key here is to acknowledge these weaknesses and find ways to minimize their impact. This might involve seeking training or resources, restructuring certain business operations, or in some cases, completely letting go of certain activities if they're not delivering value.

2. **Opportunities**: These are external factors you could capitalize on to grow or improve your business. To leverage opportunities, you should first identify them through market research and customer feedback. Once you've identified these opportunities, you can develop strategies to seize them, which could involve introducing new products or services, expanding to new markets, or forming strategic partnerships.

3. **Threats**: These are external factors that could negatively affect your business. The goal is to anticipate these threats before they do significant harm. Strategies for dealing with threats can include diversifying your offerings to reduce dependency on a single product, investing in disaster recovery planning, and staying alert to changes in market trends and competitor activities.

Balancing all these dimensions will ensure that you're not only building on your strengths but also addressing your weaknesses, making the most of your opportunities, and protecting yourself against threats. It's a holistic approach to strategic planning and business improvement.

---

I feel that these three other dimensions play to a more resilient posture.

---

Absolutely, resilience in a business context is all about adaptability and being able to withstand and bounce back from challenges. In terms of the SWOT analysis, this translates to:

1. **Weaknesses**: Addressing your weaknesses makes your business more resilient by reducing vulnerabilities. For example, improving staff training and retention strategies or investing in technology to manage debt can mitigate the impact of these issues.

2. **Opportunities**: Seizing opportunities contributes to resilience by providing new avenues for growth and diversification. For example, tapping into the catering market or using technology to take online orders can create new revenue streams, reducing reliance on walk-in sales.

3. **Threats**: Mitigating threats increases resilience by helping to safeguard your business from potential harm. Proactively dealing with competition, planning for potential price increases, or complying with regulations are all ways of managing threats.

In essence, dealing with these three dimensions helps fortify your business against both internal and external challenges, thus building resilience. The more you can adapt and manage change in these areas, the more resilient your business will be.

---

And a strength doesn't generally require additional investment. The other three all do.

---

Indeed, you're right. Building on strengths usually involves maximizing what you already have in place, which often doesn't require a significant amount of additional investment. On the other hand, addressing weaknesses, seizing opportunities, and mitigating threats typically involve investing additional resources - whether that's money, time, or effort.

For example, improving a weak area might necessitate additional training programs or hiring new staff, both of which are investments. Exploiting an opportunity might require launching a new product line or expanding to a new market, which also entails investment. Mitigating threats can mean investing in better security measures or paying for compliance efforts.

The key here for a small business owner, like the pizza shop owner, is to carefully consider each investment to ensure it will yield a sufficient return in terms of improving the business' overall position. Making wise investments that provide value in the long term can help the business grow and thrive.

---

Sure, here's the HERE framework table with marking for when a strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat needs to be front and center:
