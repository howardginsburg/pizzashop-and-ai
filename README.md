# pizzashop-and-ai

This little repo plays off of Andrew Ng's [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_ng_how_ai_could_empower_any_business) on the business value of AI and the example he gave of helping a pizza shop become more successful with AI. This is a set of six notebooks for AI aficionados in Semantic Kernel to build on Ng's vision of the future where AI is accessible to everyone.

## Overview

There are two notebooks that lay out the space:

* e1-start-here: Get your SK environment ready
* e2-the-menu: The "why" of these examples
* e3-... six notebooks coming soon
* e9-the-ending: Close this all off
