# pizzashop-and-ai

This little repo plays off of Andrew Ng's [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_ng_how_ai_could_empower_any_business) on the business value of AI and the example he gave of helping a pizza shop become more successful with AI. This is a set of six notebooks for Semantic Kernel community members to build on Ng's vision of the future where AI is accessible to everyone.
