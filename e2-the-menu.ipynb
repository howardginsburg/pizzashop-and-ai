    "\n",
    "1. **Strengths**\n",
    "    - What unique recipes or ingredients does the pizza shop use?\n",
    "    - What are the skills and experience of the staff?\n",
    "    - Does the pizza shop have a strong reputation in the local area?\n",
    "    - Are there any unique features of the shop or its location that attract customers?\n",
    "2. **Weaknesses**\n",
    "    - What are the operational challenges of the pizza shop? (e.g., slow service, high staff turnover)\n",
    "    - Are there financial constraints that limit growth or improvements?\n",
    "    - Are there any gaps in the product offering?\n",
    "    - Are there customer complaints or negative reviews that need to be addressed?\n",
    "3. **Opportunities**\n",
    "    - Is there potential for new products or services (e.g., catering, delivery)?\n",
    "    - Are there under-served customer segments or market areas?\n",
    "    - Can new technologies or systems enhance the business operations?\n",
    "    - Are there partnerships or local events that can be leveraged for marketing?\n",
    "4. **Threats**\n",
    "    - Who are the major competitors and what are they offering?\n",
    "    - Are there potential negative impacts due to changes in the local area (e.g., construction, closure of nearby businesses)?\n",
    "    - Are there economic or industry trends that could impact the business negatively (e.g., increased ingredient costs)?\n",
    "    - Is there any risk due to changes in regulations or legislation (e.g., health and safety, employment)?"
