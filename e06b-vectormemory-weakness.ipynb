    "To successfully expand your menu with calzones, you should consider the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recipe Development: Use your award-winning garlic pizza recipe as a base for your calzones. You already have a unique selling point with your garlic pizza, so incorporating this into your calzones could be a great way to differentiate your product from others. You could also consider introducing 'hip' ingredients that appeal to the younger demographic.\n",
    "2. Staff Training: Ensure your staff are well trained in the new calzone recipes. This will ensure consistency in product quality and help reduce any potential increase in preparation time.\n",
    "3. Test Run: Before fully committing to the new menu item, consider introducing calzones as a limited-time offer. This will allow you to gauge customer response and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback.\n",
    "4. Marketing: Once you're ready to fully launch your calzones, make sure to market them effectively. Highlight the unique aspects of your calzones, such as the award-winning garlic base and the 'hip' ingredients.\n",
    "5. Cost Analysis: Keep a close eye on the cost of the new ingredients and the impact on your overall profit margin. If the calzones are popular and sell well, they could help offset the cost of the new ingredients and increase overall sales.\n",
    "6. Seating Area Renovation: As you're expanding your menu, it might also be a good time to renovate your seating area. A fresh, new look could attract more customers and provide a better dining experience, complementing your expanded menu.\n",
    "7. Remember, the key to successful menu expansion is to stay true to your brand while also meeting the demands of your customers. Good luck!"
