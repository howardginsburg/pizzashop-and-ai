    "We want to get a sense of the challenges of the pizza shop owner, so we take the time to interview them to best understand their Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats -- so-called \"SWOT Analysis.\" The interview questions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strengths**\n",
    "    - What unique recipes or ingredients does the pizza shop use?\n",
    "    - What are the skills and experience of the staff?\n",
    "    - Does the pizza shop have a strong reputation in the local area?\n",
    "    - Are there any unique features of the shop or its location that attract customers?\n",
    "2. **Weaknesses**\n",
    "    - What are the operational challenges of the pizza shop? (e.g., slow service, high staff turnover)\n",
    "    - Are there financial constraints that limit growth or improvements?\n",
    "    - Are there any gaps in the product offering?\n",
    "    - Are there customer complaints or negative reviews that need to be addressed?\n",
    "3. **Opportunities**\n",
    "    - Is there potential for new products or services (e.g., catering, delivery)?\n",
    "    - Are there under-served customer segments or market areas?\n",
    "    - Can new technologies or systems enhance the business operations?\n",
    "    - Are there partnerships or local events that can be leveraged for marketing?\n",
    "4. **Threats**\n",
    "    - Who are the major competitors and what are they offering?\n",
    "    - Are there potential negative impacts due to changes in the local area (e.g., construction, closure of nearby businesses)?\n",
    "    - Are there economic or industry trends that could impact the business negatively (e.g., increased ingredient costs)?\n",
    "    - Is there any risk due to changes in regulations or legislation (e.g., health and safety, employment)?"

    "\n",
    "### Building on strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose to build on a few of the pizza shop owner's existing strengths to grow their business. This is generally the most prudent course of action because it's what's typically considered \"a good offensive maneuver\" ‚Äî because after all, you're more likely to win where you're winning the most. \n",

    "| The best garlic pizza in the business | The store owner was trained in Sicily |\n",
    "| ![](assets/garlicpizza.png) | ![](assets/measuring.png) |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also help make the business more efficient by addressing a few of their weaknesses. This is more of a defensive approach which plays well when a business has a working offense. Starting with one's strengths and then addressing a weakness tends to be a better tactic ‚Äî but then again, sometimes a business' weakness can kill it so quickly that its strengths never get dialed up in time. Keep in mind that the circumstances are always fluid, and so being *agile* will always matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "| WEAKNESS 1 | WEAKNESS 2 |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| High turnover in under-skilled employees | Calzones are trending but not on the menu | \n",
    "| ![](assets/workersleaving.png) | ![](assets/calzones.png) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, with the right balance of leveraging strengths and addressing weaknesses, there may be room for the business to investigate opportunities to grow the business by reaching into new markets with product modifications and/or by launching entirely new products. And as the business attempts to take on more uncertainty and risk, it's prudent for the business to imagine and prepare for how to make itself more resilient. By being more resilient, it becomes possible to take on more risk to reap more rewards. In absence of designing itself for resilience, the business can take on too much risk and fold when an unexpected failure occurs.\n",
